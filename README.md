# UniMelb_Sumba

The objective of this script is to align all 122 reads from the paper “Interactive transcriptome analysis of malaria patients and infecting Plasmodium falciparum” (SRA study: DRP000987, downloaded from the SRA Run selector: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=DRP000987&go=go) and perform RNASeq analysis.

The pseudoaligner Kallisto was used (v0.43.1) to align all of the 122 samples. The manual for the Kallisto pseudoaligner can be found here: https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/manual

Human cDNA was downloaded from ENSEMBL, release 89, through FTP.

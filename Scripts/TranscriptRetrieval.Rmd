First select the proper filters from Biomart:

Filters:
Transcript type: protein-coding
Transcript support level: only

Attributes:
Gene stable ID
Transcript stable ID
Transcript support levels (TSL)
Gencoode basic annotation

Tick "Unique results only"

Download this as a csv file through Biomart and filter for transcripts with tsl1, tsl2, and tsl3 support levels.

```{bash}

grep -E 'tsl1|tsl2|tsl3' /Users/katalinabobowik/Downloads/mart_export-1.txt | awk -F',' '{print $2}' > ~/Documents/proteinCodingTranscripts_Filtered_TranscriptIDs.txt

```

Next, upload the filtered text file to Biomart (tick "Input external references ID list" under filters" and select "transcript stable IDs" from the dropdown"). Tick cDNA under Attributes (Gene Stable ID and cDNA sequences are already selected).

Download as compressed FASTA file
